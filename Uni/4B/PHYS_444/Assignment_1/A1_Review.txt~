It seems the topic has been completely covered. Will see what happens.

Check your quatation marks. Remember that in Latex it is different to enter quotation marks depending on the compiler. The general technique is ``words here".

Would prefer to have the solutions written in Latex, but I suppose that is preference more than anything.

In section 1.7 Causality, you may want to explain the light cone causality more eloquently. In particular, consider the sentance "This statement that an effect cannot be caused by a cause outside of its "past" light cone is consistent with the fact that information cannot travel faster thatn the speed of light...". This sounds awkward, and though I understand what you mean, I would recommend a better way of phrasing it.
