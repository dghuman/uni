\textbf{Question 1}

\textbf{(a)} First, we need to check that the polynomial is irreducible. Using Mod-2 irreducibility we see
\[ \bar{f}(x) = x^{3} + x^{2} + 1 \implies \bar{f}(0) = 1 \quad \& \quad \bar{f}(1) = 1\]
so $f(x)$ is irreducible, and since $\Q$ is perfect, we know $f(x)$ is also seperable. Thus, we first need to find the depressed cubic $f(x)$ corresponds with. Notice, if we let $g(x) = f(x - 1)$, we get
\[ g(x) = (x-1)^{3} +3(x-1)^{2} - 2(x-1) + 1 = (x^{2} - 2x + 1)(x+2) - 2x + 3 = x^{3} + 2x^{2} - 2x^{2} - 4x + x + 2 - 2x + 3\]
\[ g(x) = x^{3} -5x +1 \]
and we see that the discriminant is
\[ \text{disc}(g(x)) = -4(-5)^{3} - 27(5)^{2} < 0 \]
which is not a perfect square, and so we can conclude that $\Gal(f(x)) \cong S_{3}$.

\textbf{(b)} We know $f(x) = x^{4} + 3x +3$ is irreducible by 3-Eisenstien, and thus also seperable. We have
\[ \text{Res}(f(x)) = x^{3} - 12x - 9 \, .\]
This is not irreducible, and we know that -3 is a root of this polynomial. So, we can see that
\[ \text{Res}(f(x)) = (x+3)(x^{2} - 3x - 3)\]
where the quadratic is irreducible by 3-Eisenstien. So, we need to find the size of the Galois group of Res$(f(x))$, but we see that $\Gal(f(x)) \cong \Z_{2}$, and so $m=2$. Thus, we need to check if the Galois group of $f(x)$ is isomorphic to $\Z_{4}$ or $D_{4}$. Let $u=-3$, and $L$ the splitting field of $\text{Res}(f(x))$, then consider
\[ x^{2} + 3x + 3 \hspace{4em} \& \hspace{4em} x^{2} + 3\, .\]
Notice that the roots of $x^{2} -3x -3$ are
\[ \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 12}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{21}}{2}  =\frac{3 \pm \sqrt{3\cdot 7}{2}}\, .\]
Notice that the second polynomial has roots $\pm i\sqrt{3}$ and this clearly does not split over $L$. So, we see that
\[\Gal(f(x)) = D_{4} \, .\]

\textbf{(c)} If $f(x) = x^{4} + 4x^{2} + 1$, then we first check if $f(x)$ is irreducible. We try the Mod-3 irreducibility,

\[ \text{Res}(f(x)) = x^{3} - 4x^{2} - 4x +16 =(x-2)(x^{2} - 2x -8) = (x-2)(x-4)(x+2) \, .\]
So, we have that the resolvant splits over $\Q$, and so $|\Gal(\text{Res}(f(x)))| = 1$, and thus
\[ \Gal(f(x)) \cong \Z_{2}\times \Z_{2} \, .\]

\newpage
\textbf{Question 2}

It suffices to show that the two groups have different sizes. To see this, we first find the roots of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. Notice that they are $\frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\pm i\sqrt{3}$ respectively. But, this just means that both polynomials have the same splitting field, $\Q(i\sqrt{3})$, which is Galois by construction. Thus, both polynomials have the same Galois group, $\Gal(p(x)) = \Gal(q(x))$. Then, we see that $p(x)q(x)$ will still split over $\Q(i\sqrt{3})$, and since it is galois, $|\Gal(p(x)q(x))| = |\Q(i\sqrt{3})|$ but $|\Gal(p(x)) \times \Gal(q(x))| = |\Gal(p(x))|\times |\Gal(q(x))| = |\Q(i\sqrt{3})|\cdot |\Q(i\sqrt{3})|$, as required.

\newpage
\textbf{Question 3}

First, we see that since $f(x)$ is irreducible, we know that $G$ is transitive. However, since $G$ is galois, we know hat $|G| = [K:F]$, and if the degree of $\text{deg}(f(x)) = n$ we get that $G \leq S_{n}$. So, we need a transitive and abelian subgroup of $S_{n}$, but from group theory we recall this is a group of order $n$, and thus
\[ |G| = [K:F] = n = \text{deg}(f(x)) \]
as required.

\newpage
\textbf{Question 4}

We wish to find a polynomial of degree 3 that splits over $K$. To see this, we know by the Fundemental Theorem of Galois Theory that $\exists \,E \in \mathcal{E}$ such that $[E:F] = 3$. Moreover, by the primitive element theorem, we can gurentee that $\exists \, \alpha \in K$ such that $E = F(\alpha)$. Since $K$ is Galois, it is Normal, and thus the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$ splits in $K$, and moreover, if $p(x) \in F[x]$ is the minimal polynomial, then $\text{deg}(p(x))= 3$ by construction. Suppose $\beta\in K$ is another root of $p(x)$. However, we notice that the only non-trivial normal subgroup of $S_{3}$ is $A_{3}$, but by the fundemental theorem this corresponds with a Field $L \in \mathcal{E}$ such that $[L:F] = 2$, and so $\beta \notin E$, and hence can only be in $K$, and thus the splitting field of $p(x)$ is $K$.

\newpage
\textbf{Question 5}

It suffices to show that the Galois Group of $f(x)$ is isomorphic to $A_{3}$ from our theory. First, we know $f(x)$ is irreducible over $F$, so we know that $\Gal(f(x))$ is transitive, which forces $\Gal(f(x)) \cong S_{3}$ or $A_{3}$. Next, we know that $F$ is finite, so suppose Char$(F) = p > 3$, with $p$ prime, and let $K$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$. Notice, since $f(x)$ is cubic and irreducible, then none of the roots of $f(x)$ are in $F$. In particular, suppose $\alpha \in K$ is such a root. We know that finite extensions of finite fields are finite fields, and so $F(\alpha)$ is a finite field. Moreover, $F(\alpha)/\Z_{p}$ is Galois, since it is the splitting field of $x^{p^{m}} - x$ over $\Z_{p}$. But, since this is Galois, then $F(\alpha)/F$ is Galois and so $F(\alpha) = K$. However, since the minimal polynmial of $\alpha$ is $f(x)$, then
\[ |G| = [K:F] = [F(\alpha):F] = 3 \implies G \cong A_{3} \]
and the result follows.
