\textbf{Question 1}

First we will find the order of this group. We see that if we consider all $2\times 2$ matrices over $\Z_{3}$, then that is $3^{4}$ possible elements. Since this is $GL_{2}(\Z_{3})$, we know to expect less elements, since we require they be invertible. We recognize invertability can be found with the determinant, and that the determinant is zero only if we have pairing of elements. That is, suppose
\[ A =
\begin{bmatrix}
  a & b \\
  c & d \\
\end{bmatrix}
\hspace{2em} a,b,c,d \,\in \Z_{3} \, .\]
Then, we know that $det(A) = ad - bc = 0 \iff a=c \,\&\, b=d$ or $a=b \,\&\, c = d$, which is $4\times 3^{2} -3$ elements (where the 4 comes from overlap of the three matrices with all elements the same). Then,
\[ |GL_{2}(\Z_{3})| = 3^{4} - 4\cdot 3^{2} + 3 = 48 = 6\cdot 8 = 3\cdot2^{4}\,.\]
By the first Sylow theorem, we see that the size of the Sylow 3-subgroups is just 3. By the third Sylow theorem, we know
\[ n_{3} = 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 3) \hspace{2em} \& \hspace{2em} n_{3} | 2^{4} = 16 \,.\]
So, our candidates for $n_{3}$ are 1,4 and 16. To actually find the subgroups, we only need find one and then apply the second Sylow theorem, since the rest better be conjugates of the one we find. From inspection, we notice that the three elements of the Sylow 3-subgroup better be the identity, some element of $GL_{2}(\Z_{3})$ and its inverse. That is, we need a group that is generated by a single element and is of order 3. We notice that we can get
