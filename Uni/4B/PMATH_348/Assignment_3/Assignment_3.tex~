\textbf{Question 1}

\textbf{(a)} We notice a root by inspection. In particular, we can see that
\[ f(-1) = -8 + 3 -1 + 2 - 5 + 9 = 0 \]
and since $-1 = 10 (\text{mod} \, 11)$, we have that $x= 10$ is a root of this polynomial over the Field $\Z_{11}$, and hence is reducible.

\textbf{(b)} Again, by inspection we note that this is not factorable over $\R$, and hence will not be reducable over $\R$.

\textbf{(c)}

\textbf{(d)} We show this is irreducible through the Mod 5 irreducibility test. That is,
\[ \bar{f}(x) = x^{3} - 2x+2 (\text{mod}\, 5)\]
and we see that $\bar{f}(0) = 2, \bar{f}(1) = 1,\bar{f}(2) = 1,\bar{f}(3) = 3,\bar{f}(4) = 3$, and since deg$(f(x)) = $deg$(\bar{f}(x))$, we can conclude that $f(x)$ is irreducible in $\Z$.

\textbf{(e)} We look at this polynomial as a ring with coeffecients in $\Q (y)$. Consider the prime ideal $\langle p \rangle \in \Q(y)$, we notice that $y\, |\, y^{5}$, $y | y^{3}$ but $y^{2} \nmid y$ and hence we can apply Eisenstein's Criterion and $f(x,y)$ is irreducible over $\Q [x,y]$.

\newpage
\textbf{Question 2}

\textbf{(a)} Suppose $f(x)\in F[x]$ is reducible. Then, $\exists g(x),h(x)\in F[x]$ with $g(x),h(x)\notin F^{\times}$ such that $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, and thus we see that $f(x+a) = g(x+a)h(x+a)$ will be a non-trivial factorization of $f(x+a)$ and thus $f(x+a)$ will be reducible. The proof follows exactly the same way in the other direction, and hence both contrapositives have been shown and we can conclude $f(x)$ is irreducible if and only if $f(x+a)$ is irreducible.

\textbf{(b)} Notice
\[ f(x+1) = (x+1)^{4} + 1 = x^{4} + 4x^{3} + 6x^{2} + 4x + 2 \]
and by Eisenstien's Criterion on 2 we have irreducibility. From \textbf{(a)} we have that $f(x)$ is also irreducible.
\newpage
\textbf{Question 3}

\textbf{(a)} We need to find the minimal polynomial associated with this root. Notice,
\[ \alpha = i + \sqrt{2} \implies \alpha^{2} = -1 + 2\sqrt{2}i + 2 = 2\sqrt{2} + 1
