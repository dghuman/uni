\chapter{Simulation}

As P-ONE has only deployed the Pathfinder missions thus far, including STRAW and STRAWb, the data used in this thesis is primarily simulated. In particular, the data needs to be usable to test and build a reconstruction algorthim for muon-neutrinos. This means simulating muon tracks. For this reason, we lightly cover the simulation process used to produce data including the pre-existing IceCube Framework, Simulating Neutrinos, Simulating Muons and the Detector Response. 

\section{IceCube Framework}

The software framework already exists from IceCube, and in order to minimize the amount of new code needed to simulate P-ONE it is simplest to use the IceCube software. In particular, the software documentation is readily available \cite{icetray} and referred to as IceTray. This is meant to be a full framework capable of simulating, reconstructing and analysis all in one \cite{icetray}. For the purposes of P-ONE, we wish to only use the simulation subset of the framework as it is primarily made using open-source software, and hence can avoid potential proprietary issues.

The bulk of the code is written in C++ with the goal of being modular. This means that rather than writing scripts that call functions or classes that are pre-existing, the code is designed so that there is a single steering script that calls modules to run tasks including the simulation of muons or neutrinos, and including geometry files. Modules can be added by users as well to then be included in the steering scripts. The code has also been wrapped using Python so that modules can be reached via python scripts, and hence steering scripts can be written in Python. For this reason, Python is the language of choice for the purposes of this work.

\section{Simulating Neutrinos}

The sofware used to generate neutrinos is the very aptly named Neutrino-Generator (NuGen) \cite{icetray}. This is code written in IceTray based off of the All Neutrino Interaction Generator (ANIS), a high energy neutrino generator used for neutrino telescopes. NuGen has the capabilities of preparing and injecting a neutrino and interacting along the way if they so happen, and then forcing an interaction in the detector. NuGen can also produce secondaries. However, NuGen does not propogate photons nor charged leptons. This is saved for PROPOSAL and CLSim, where the former is used to propogate charged leptons and the latter is used to produce and propogate photons in a parallel manner (if using GPUs). 

\section{Simulating Muons}

Do we talk about Muon Gun or Cosmic Muons? Currently only Cosmic Muons are being used but both could be used.

\section{Detector Response}

This has to include the detector geometry (GCD) files, the DOMs, and efficiency...?
