\chapter{Introduction}

The cosmic sky has entranced humans for as far as recorded history can trace. As technology evolved, so too did the observation of the universe around us; from the naked eye to primitive telescopes, and eventually to present day space telescopes, like the Hubble Space Telescope and the upcoming James Web Space Telescope \textbf{(NEED TO CITE THESE)}. These growing technological leaps have also resulted in the exploration of the incredibly small and eventually resulted in the discovery of the neutrino \cite{aneut}. It was perhaps inevitable that these two seemingly separate areas of physics would eventually meet. 

\section{Neutrinos}

The neutrino is a fundemental particle first proposed by Wolfgang Pauli \cite{nu_proposition}, and then later discovered in 1956 using the byproducts of $\beta^{-}$ decay \cite{aneut}. As research continued into the elusive neutrino, another flavour of neutrino was discovered in 1962 called the muon neutrino ($\nu_{\mu}$) \cite{m_nu} and eventually the final flavour of the tau neutrino ($\nu_\tau$) \cite{t_nu}. 

\subsection{Interactions}

Neutrinos are neutral and interact only through the Weak interaction. The Weak interaction is a force that is mediated by the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$ massive bosons, and is the force responsible for decays. The main vertices involved in neutrino interactions are shown in Figure \cite{fig:n_vert}, where we see the lepton
