\chapter{Reconstruction}

A telescope is only as good as it's ability to identify distinct sources. In the case of a neutrino telescope this translates directly to how well observed events can be reconstructed for the direction of high energy events. IceCube ises several reconstruction methods \cite{icecube} and has several data quality checks it must go through before a result is given any weight. Similarly, ANTARES has had years of work put into the reconstruction software in order to reach the accuracies is t can now \cite{antares}. There are several software techniques that need to be applied before a result can be taken seriously, and usually this pipline begins with a simple and quick initial guess fit. 

\section{Linefit}

Any robust reconstruction method requires an initial guess (generally referred to as a seed) in order to be used, but getting this first guess can be non-trivial. Moreover, reconstruction piplines can be incredibly sensitive to the initial guess and ensuring the quality of this fit is difficult in its own right.

The standard method for a first guess in such situations is the linefit/linear fit. This is a simple track fit that minimizes the $\chi^{2}$ on the observed hits given in an event.
