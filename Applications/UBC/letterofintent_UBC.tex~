Dear Graduate Coordinator,
My name Dilraj Ghuamn and I am applying for a Master's in physics to UBC. 
\section{Research}
I have had two major research positions over my undergraduate career. I worked as a USRA at SNOLab under Chris Jillings, employed by Laurentian, with the DEAP collaboration where I worked mainly on characterizing Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) for the experiment. The second research position was at TRIUMF under Mark Scott and Thomas Lindner in the T2K group working on the construction of the Multi-PMT prototype for the NuPrism extension of T2K.

My USRA at SNOLab with DEAP was over the Fall term of 2017, from September to December. The Dark Matter Experiment using Argon Pulseshape discrimination (DEAP) is a  During my time at SNOLab I worked with under the supervision of Chris Jillings with whom I worked characterizing PMTs used in the DEAP experiment
