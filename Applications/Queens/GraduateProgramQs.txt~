Type of Physics interested in:

I have an interest in both Theory and Experimental. My interest in theory arises from the background of courses I have taken in my undergraduate career, majority of which have been theoretically driven, including multiple pure math courses taken out of an interest for the subjects (Algebra and Geometry). For this reason, I find myself interested in working in a theory based environment and I am motivated to attempt and apply the mathematics I have learned in a physics based setting.
