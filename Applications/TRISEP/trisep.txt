I would appreciate the opportunity attend TRISEP 2021 for a few reasons: networking with students in similar fields, attending lectures held by noteworthy researchers, and covering topics of particular interest to my current and future research. As TRISEP is a joint effort by SNOLAB, TRIUMF and PI, it attracts students from both theoretical and experimental backgrounds alike. This provides an excellent opportunity to meet researchers in particle physics and form a network to support future endeavours. The orginization commitee has also gathered an exceptional array of lecturers that will cover topics of particular interest to myself, including statistical methods and particle physics subjects. With my research being primarly neutrino/muon track reconstruction, both the statistical and particle physics topics will prove useful in my future research. This benefit will carry further into my PhD as I am pursuing a similar subject in the future. Due to these reasons, the opportunity to attend TRISEP would be beneficial for my research and academic endeavours.
