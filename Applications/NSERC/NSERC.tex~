Proposal of Research For NSERC

The proposed research for the Master's is to extend the work done in describing the dynamics of Dirac particles in a Kerr-Newman black hole geometry \cite{atmp}. It seems natural to be able to extend this behaviour of Dirac particles near a black hole's event horizon to higher dimensional spaces, and still expect similar results. In particular, in this black hole geometry, we see no rise of fixed orbits for dirac particles near the black hole event horizon, and instead expect either the particle to fall into the event horizon or to drift away \cite{cpam}.

A black hole is a an extremely dense body, so dense in fact that even light cannot escape from the interior of the mass \cite{gr}. In particular, a spherically symmetric mass is called a black hole if the radius of the mass is equal to the \textit{Shwarzschild Radius}, which comes from Schwarzschild's solution to Einstein's field equations, which diverge at such a radius \cite{gr}. This Schwarzschild space-time gives rise to a \textit{singularity}, the centre of the black hole, and an \textit{event horizon}, the boundry beyond which nothing escapes \cite{mbh}.

The Shwarzschild solution requires a spherically symmetric mass and is stationary. On the other hand, the Kerr solutions provides a broader family of solutions, wherein the family of solutions are dependent upon only the mass of the black hole and it's angular momentum to exactly describe the stellar object \cite{mbh}. This is an incredibly powerful metric, as it allows for relaxation of the spherical symmetry forced in the Shwarzschild solution, but further allows the exploration of the geometry surrounding all physically realizeable black holes that arise via gravitational collapse of stellar masses \cite{mbh}.
